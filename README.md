## DC DRAMA

DC Drama is a webapplication that scrapes a local Washington, DC blog [(Popville)](https://www.popville.com) and displays the articles from the homepage. The articles are saved into a mongo database and displayed with react. Users are also able to empty the database and clear the frontend.
